Hi guys , I share with you a simple script that I developed in order to automate the scan and reports generation of the following tools during a Web Application Pentest: Nmap , Nikto and Dirsearch.
I hope you enjoy the tool!



Installation : 
git clone https://github.com/wakedxy/weban.git
chmod +x weban.py  
chmod +x __init__/dirsearch/dirsearch.py
